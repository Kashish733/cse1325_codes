I ALMOST JUMPED OUT OF MY SKIN
I AM NOT A CROOK
I APOLOGIZE
I APPROVE
I ASKED YOU FIRST
I BEFORE E EXCEPT AFTER C
I BRANCHED OUT
I BURST OUT LAUGHING
I CAME I SAW I CONQUERED
I CAN DO IT WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND MY BACK
I CAN DREAM CAN'T I?
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
I CAN READ YOU LIKE A BOOK
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT
I CAN'T EAT ANOTHER BITE
I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME
I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION
I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE BABY
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK
I CAN'T KNOCK IT
I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND
I CAN'T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON IT
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT
I CANNOT TELL A LIE DETECTOR
I COULD HAVE DANCED ALL NIGHT
I COULD KICK MYSELF
I COULD KISS YOU
I COULD USE A LITTLE R AND R
I COULD WRITE A BOOK
I COULD'VE BEEN A CONTENDER
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
I COULDN'T EAT ANOTHER BITE
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID BETTER MYSELF
I DIDN'T SLEEP A WINK
I DO
I DON'T BUY THAT FOR A MINUTE
I DON'T HAVE A THING TO WEAR
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME
I DOZED OFF
I DREAM OF JEANNIE
I DREW A BLANK
I FEEL IT IN MY BONES
I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN
I FEEL LUCKY
I FIBBED
I FIGURED
I GAVE IT MY ALL
I GET THE MESSAGE

I GET YOUR DRIFT
I GOOFED
I GOT A JOB
I GOT A REAL KICK OUT OF IT
I GOT MY WISH
I GOT SIDETRACKED
I GOT YOU BABE THE BLUE OX
I HAD A HUNCH
I HAD MY HEART SET ON IT
I HAD NO IDEA
I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS
I HATE TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO BUT I TOLD YOU SO
I HATE TO SEE A GROWN MAN CRY
I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU
I HAVE A CLOGGED DRAIN
I HAVE NOT YET BEGUN TO FIGHT
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY
I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST IDEA
I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME
I HEREBY SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
I HIT PAY DIRT
I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE
I JUST CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
I JUST HAD A THOUGHT
I KNEW IN A MOMENT IT MUST BE ST. NICK
I KNEW IT

I LOVE A PARADE
I LOVE LUCY
I LOVE LUCY RERUNS
I LOVE PARIS IN THE SPRINGTIME
I LOVE WHAT YOU DO FOR ME
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT
I MUST BE HEARING THINGS
I MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT
I NEARLY LOST MY SHIRT AND TIE
I NEED A LITTLE R AND R
I NEED A MOMENT TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
I NEED TO UNWIND
I NEVER FORGET A FACE
I NEVER MET A MAN I DIDN'T LIKE
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY
I OBJECT
I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG
I REST MY CASE
I SAW IT COMING A MILE AWAY
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES
I SHALL RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY DOCTOR
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY HIPPOPOTAMUS
I SMELL A RAT
I SPEAK FLUENT FRENCH TOAST
I SWEAR I WON'T TELL A SOUL
I TAWT I TAW A PUDDY TAT
I THINK I CAN OF TUNA
I THINK I LOVE YOU BY THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY
I THINK I'VE CREATED A MONSTER
I THINK YOU’RE ON TO SOMETHING
I WANT A KINDER GENTLER NATION
I WANT MY MTV
I WANT TO BE ALONE
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND LOTION
I WANTED YOU TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW
I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT
I WHISTLE A HAPPY TUNE-UP
I WISH I MAY I WISH I MIGHT
I WON THE GAME
I WON'T BE VERY LONG JOHN SILVER
I WON'T GROW UP
I WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER
I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I CAN'T
I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY
I WOULDN'T STEER YOU WRONG
I WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT WITH A TEN-FOOT POLE
I YAM WHAT I YAM
I'D BEND OVER BACKWARDS FOR YOU
I'D DO IT IN A HEARTBEAT
I'D KNOW THAT FACE ANYWHERE
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST & JELLY
I'D LIKE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE

ISTANBUL TURKEY
ISTHMUS OF PANAMA
IT ALL ADDS UP
IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS
IT BAFFLES ME
IT CAME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE
IT COMES FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE
IT COST A PRETTY PENNY
IT COULDN'T BE EASIER
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN TO A NICER GUY
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN TO A NICER PERSON
IT DIDN'T FAZE ME
IT DOESN'T HURT TO ASK
IT FILLS MY HEART WITH JOY
IT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND IT OVER
IT FITS YOU LIKE A GLOVE COMPARTMENT
IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS
IT GOES IN ONE EAR AND OUT THE OTHER
IT HAD TO BE YOU
IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY
IT HAS SENTIMENTAL VALUE
IT HELPS THE MEDICINE GO DOWN SINGS MARY POPPINS
IT JUST DAWNED ON ME
IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS
IT LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION
IT LOOKS LIKE FUN
IT MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY
IT MAKES CENTS
IT MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL AN EGG
IT MAKES MY HEAD SPIN OR SOLVE
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
IT MAY SOUND CORNY BUT IT'S TRUE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE
IT NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME
IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
IT RETURNS TO THE THROWER
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY
IT SLIPPED MY MIND
IT SPEAKS VOLUMES
IT SUDDENLY DAWNED ON ME
IT SUITS YOU TO A T-BONE STEAK
IT TAKES A LICKING AND KEEPS ON TICKING
IT TAKES MY BREATH AWAY WE GO
IT THREW ME FOR A LOOP
IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
IT TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN
IT TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY
IT TOWERS ABOVE THE REST
IT WAS A TOTAL FLUKE
IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED
IT WAS GREAT WHILE IT LASTED
IT WAS RIGHT ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE
IT WAS TOLD TO ME IN STRICT CONFIDENCE
IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW
IT WORKS EVERY TIME
IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE
IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET
IT'LL DO IN A PINCH OF SALT
IT'LL DO YOU A WORLD OF GOOD
IT'LL DO YOU A WORLD OF GOOD VIBES
IT'S A BABY BOY FOR SUPERSTAR CELINE DION
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
IT'S A BLESSING IN DISGUISE
IT'S A BOY
IT'S A BREEZE
IT'S A CINCH
IT'S A DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD RECORD
IT'S A FINE LINE
IT'S A MIRACLE
IT'S A MIRACLE OF MODERN SCIENCE
IT'S A MOST UNUSUAL DAY
IT'S A MYSTERY
IT'S A NARRATIVE OR A SECTION OF A BUILDING
IT'S A SLAM DUNK
IT'S A SMALL WORLD
IT'S A SURE THING
IT'S A TOUGH JOB BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT
IT'S A WALK OF FAME STAR FOR MICHAEL J. FOX
IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE
IT'S ALL DONE WITH MIRRORS
IT'S ALL GOOD
IT'S ALL IN THE WRIST
IT'S ALL THE RAGE
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME
IT'S ALL VERY HUSH-HUSH
IT'S ALL WITHIN YOUR REACH
IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN
IT'S AN INSIDE JOKE
IT'S BEYOND COMPARE
IT'S BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS
IT'S CALLED THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH
IT'S CALLED THE MOTHER OF INVENTION
IT'S EASIER THAN YOU THINK
IT'S EASY MONEY
IT'S EASY TO DO
IT'S EVERYWHERE YOU WANT TO BE
IT'S GOT ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
IT'S HARD TO RESIST
IT'S HIT OR MISS
IT'S JUST A FORMALITY
IT'S JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY
IT'S JUST TO DIE FOR
IT'S JUST WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
IT'S JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED
IT'S MY FIRM BELIEF
IT'S MY KIND OF TOWN
IT'S MY PLEASURE
IT'S NICKNAMED THE GOLDEN STATE
IT'S NO LAUGHING MATTER
IT'S NO SKIN OFF MY NOSE
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS AS USUAL
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS
IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA BAGS
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL COMPUTER
IT'S NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT
IT'S NOW OR NEVER
IT'S NOW OR NEVER-NEVER LAND
IT'S OKAY BY ME
IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD
IT'S POURING
IT'S QUOTED THAT THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THIS
IT'S RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE
IT'S SAID HONEY CATCHES MORE FLIES THAN THIS
IT'S SAID THAT A STITCH IN TIME SAVES THIS
IT'S SAID THAT NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF THIS
IT'S SAID THAT TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN THIS
IT'S SAID TO BE THE SPICE OF LIFE
IT'S SHEER SPECULATION
IT'S SHOWTIME
IT'S SO QUIET YOU CAN HEAR A PIN DROP
IT'S STRICTLY A PRIVATE MATTER
IT'S THE FAMOUS CARTOON CALL OF THE ROAD RUNNER
IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN CHARLIE BROWN
IT'S THE KISS OF DEATH
IT'S THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN
IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS
IT'S THE WORLD'S BUSIEST AIRPORT
IT'S TOO LATE TO TURN BACK NOW
IT'S WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME
IT'S WHAT CNN STANDS FOR
IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER
IT'S WORTH A POUND OF CURE
